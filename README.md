#FastAPI Asynchronous TODO List API

This project is a minimal and basic example of a RESTful API built with FastAPI that demonstrates how to use asynchronous programming with a PostgreSQL database.

##The main purpose of this project is to showcase the best practices for building scalable and efficient web services, including:

- Asynchronous Logic: Utilizing async/await throughout the application to handle I/O-bound operations efficiently.
- Dependency Injection: Managing database sessions using FastAPI's robust dependency injection system.
- Layered Architecture: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated layers for API Endpoints (Routers), Business Logic (Services), and Data Models (Schemas).
- SQLAlchemy ORM: Using SQLAlchemy's modern asyncio extension for asynchronous database interactions.
- Environment Variables: Securely managing database credentials with a .env file.

Getting Started

Follow the instructions to set up the environment and run the application. This project is a great starting point for anyone looking to understand modern asynchronous development with Python.
